# Atliq Technologies Sales Insights

## Introduction
I wanted to explore Power BI through a readily available database and this company has data that was published. As a result, I used this companies data to demonstrate Power BI understanding.

In this dashboard, I create three separate pages.

### Page 1: Base Insights
The **Base Insights** page essentially covers what a manager may want to know just at a quick glance.

First of all, you can quickly view revenue and sales quantity if desired and even click different years along with months throughout those years to see how the business has progressed over time. This allows managers to be able to easily see whether the business is performing well or in need of an assessment. 

Secondly, this allows easy and fast access to the top 5 customers and products during any given point throughout the year. Not only this, we can view how a particular customer has contributed to revenue and sales quantity, and the top 5 products they sold during any point in time by clicking on them as shown below. This particular example shows how Electricalsara Stores contributed to the aforementioned statistics in the year of 2020.

### Page 2: Profit Analysis
The **Profit Analysis** page covers the majority of what you would want to know about your business when it comes to profit.

As you can see, I kept the time analysis feature and revenue along with the sales quantity. However, where this page differs are it's bar charts and the table in the bottom right. This page allows the user to view what percentage of revenue any given market is contributing to their business, the percentage that they contribute to total profit, and their individual profit percentage. The table is provided to give a nice and easy to view tabular view of the numbers given in the bar char and a quick way to sift through the data if the user wanted to sort the customers by revenue contribution percentage, etc.

### Page 3: Performance Analysis
The **Performance Analysis** page provides precisely what it is named for.

I kept the typical items that should be included in a performance analysis like revenue, sales quantity, profit margin, etc. I also kept the time analysis feature as that is critical for almost all things one would want to analyze in business. The two main features that were added in this page are the profit target slider and the revenue trend bar chart.

The profit target slider allows us to see what markets are below our desired revenue contribution percentage in the bar chart below it. As you can see, it will change any market that is not at least at our desired profit target red to show the user this market is underperforming. In addition, I added a feature that allows the user to break the markets down further into different categories. For example, we can click a button to show the same thing but with respect to regions (shown in the first image below) or stores (shown in the second image below).

Finally, the new bar chart on the right hand side of the page allows the user to see revenue the current year in comparison to the revenue from the previous year. The line indicated how the profit margins have performed throughout the chosen time period as well.

## Conclusion
This Power BI dashboard allows users to interactively analyze their business quickly and easily. Everything that you can view in the images is clickable and allow the user to delve deeper into the numbers of their business. There is also a mobile layout for this dashboard; however, I cannot view it on mobile as I can't publish the dashboard to the cloud without a work email.
